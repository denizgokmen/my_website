>First of all, thank you for reading this far. My name is Deniz Gokmen. I was born in Istanbul, Turkey but I spent a majority of my childhood in Ankara,Turkey. I moved to United States to complete my bachelor degree. I majored in Finance and minored in Economics at the Ohio State University. After living 5 years at the US, I decided to pursue my graduate education in London, United Kingdom.
